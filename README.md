# Windows11-Folder-icons
Here I upload folder icons I made.

Some of them were made with the template you can find here: https://github.com/dalps/minecraft11

Feel free to ask me to create a folder for an rather unknown app or a general design you would like to use.

## What I did
- app_ico: Here I post the icons I used for myself
- vocaloid_ico: Here I made some designs for a friend, even tho he didn't ask for it. I was inspired by this one https://ko-fi.com/s/b05472eced. So I decided to do more vocaloid characters in that design.

## Additionals Comments
Did you ever notice, that if you use large symbols in your file explorer e.g. the downloads icon is a folder, but if you use the detail view, it becomes just the symbol? This is because .ico files support layers. If the image is shown very small, it searches for a more fitting smaller layer: This is presented then. The files which support this are added with a "+".
